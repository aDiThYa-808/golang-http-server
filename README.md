# golang-http-server

>⚠️ This is **NOT A PRODUCTION PROJECT**. It's a personal project I'm building to practice and become proficient in Go


A minimal HTTP server implemented using Go’s net/http package. Implemented to understand how handlers, middleware, concurrency, and context propagation work in Go.

## Features (in the current stage)
### Endpoints:
- **`/`**: endpoint that is protected by an authentication middleware. It performs no task other than printing a message. 

- **`/stats`**: endpoint that returns the request metrics like total requests, successful requests and Unauthorized requests in JSON.

- **`/work`**: endpoint that simulates a CPU bound work with context cancellation. Server stops computation immediately when the client disconnects. It also has an optional query "limit=" to set the number of computations that must be performed.<br/> 
For example `http://localhost:4000/work?limit=1000` will compute the first 1000 prime numbers.

- **`/upload`**: Recieves the file in the POST request form field. Creates a temporary file with a unique name in the `./uploads` directory using `os.CreateTemp` and copies the file to it using `io.Copy()`. Renames the temp file using os.Rename() with a safe name created by a helper method in the format `./uploads/uuid_originalFileName.extension`. `uuid` is a unique ID generated by `google/uuid` to maintain unique file names. Performs clean up when the function returns.

### Middlewares:
- **`AuthMiddleware()`**: protects the endpoints and returns 401 if the Basic Auth credentials are invalid.

- **`LoggingMiddleware()`**: logs the request's method, path, timestamp and time taken to complete the request.

- **`StatsMiddleware()`**: the outermost middleware that checks the request's status code and updates the in-memory counters using `atomic.AddInt64()` to keep track of the metrics.

- **`MaxBodySize()`**: Limits the incoming request's body size to 50 << 20 bytes in order to prevent DoS
